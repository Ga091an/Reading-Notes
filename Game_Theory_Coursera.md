## Introduction
### Self Interested Agent
__Utility function__: the fitness of the whole system
__Player__: who are the decision makers
__Actions__: what can the players do
__Payoffs__: what motivates players
__Normal Form__: like matrix form Representation, display the relativities among actions and payoffs
__Extensive Form__: including timing of moves

## Prisoner's dilemma

Two Prisoner C and D, reward c>a>d>b.

|         | C           | D  |
| ------ |:------------:| -----:|
| C      | (a,a) | (b,c) |
| D      | (c,b)      |   (d,d) |

__Competition__: adversary reward to the same action of C and D.
__Cooperation__: same reward to the same action of C and D.

__Hybrid__: not pure competition or cooperation.

## Nash equilibrium
game: player guess 1~100, the one who is closest to the 2/3 of the average guess value own the game. If there are many people win, uniformly separate the coins.

__nash equilibrium__: every player will play the best response to the others。 这个均衡是游戏中的人都采取同样的最优策略时，最终会达到个均衡点。

- a consistent list of Actions
- each payer's action maximizes his or her payoff given the actions of the others
- a self-consistent or stable profile
- nobody has an incentive to deviate from their action if an equilibrium profile is played.
- somebody has an incentive to deviate from a profile of actions that do not form an equilibrium
